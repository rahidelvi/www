This site was built using Jekyll and is hosted by Netlify. The Jekyll theme I'm using is a [modified version](https://github.com/rahidelvi/G14) of FÃ¡bio Madeira's [Jasper2](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2) a full featured port of [Ghost's](https://ghost.org/) default theme  [Capser](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

The tags page on this blog is based on [Jo Vandeginste's blog post](http://jovandeginste.github.io/2016/05/04/add-a-tag-cloud-to-my-jekyll-site.html) on the topic which I customized to work with this theme.

This was my December 2017 holiday project. I was learning how to use Jekyll, Git and GitHub.
