Thanks for visiting my little spot on the web. Here you’ll find a few links to what I’ve been posting to Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn, plus a bit of Qur'an stuff, and general musings. Good old fashioned personal website, flaws and all.

My thoughts on online privacy were naively [this][1] and lately (2019) mixed with [this][2] as well.

Wait..., you might be asking, I want to do something. Great! Here are a few options.

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;width:300px;">

**[`🛎 Schedule a meeting`][5]** if you would like to meet.

**[`🙋 Ask a question`][3]** really about anything. I'll answer if I can or refer you to someone who knows more if I can't.

**[`🎅 Sample 'Islamist' banter`][4]**

Peace.
