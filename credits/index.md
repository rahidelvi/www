This site was built using Jekyll and is hosted by Netlify with GitHub. The Jekyll theme I'm using is a [modified version](https://github.com/rahidelvi/W01) of FÃ¡bio Madeira's [Jasper2](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2), a full featured port of [Ghost's](https://ghost.org/) default theme  [Capser](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

This was my December 2017 holiday project. I was learning how to use Jekyll, Git and GitHub.
