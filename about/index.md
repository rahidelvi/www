I'm an accidental-tech fortunate to be working in the social profit space. My day job is at **[GrantBook](https://www.grantbook.org/)** where I consult on cloud based technology planning and implementation projects for philanthropies, nonprofits, and social enterprises. Outside work, you'll find me learning, volunteering and tinkering with new applications.
