My **[work][1]** stuff is on LinkedIn. Sorta. I've always found it hard to talk about my work history there.

I used to be a  "Tech consultant"
    - Managing multi-faceted projects are fun, some of them anyway
    - Worked primarily with philanthropies, nonprofits and "social enterprises"
    - This world is somewhat familiar to me, not the upper echelons obviously, but the ops and systems and things
    - Love small, mission driven and hacky teams
