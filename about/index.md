I'm an technologist fortunate to be working in the social profit space. My day job is at **[Social Profit Practitioners](https://www.socialprofit.us/)** where I help leaders in small philanthropies, charities, and social enterprises maximize their team's knowledge capacity around modern digital systems and business processes.

**Why?** From at least 2008 I've enjoyed working with social benefit teams. They're scrappy, cash strapped (sometimes), hungry to get things done, and most care about moving the needle on their social missions. Kinda nice company to keep.

Outside work, you'll find me learning, dadding, volunteering, social-media-ing and tinkering with new applications.
