I'm an technologist fortunate to be working in the social profit space. My day job is at **[Social Profit Practitioners](https://www.socialprofit.us/)** where I help leaders in small philanthropies, charities, and social enterprises maximize their team's knowledge capacity and know-how around modern digital systems and processes so they're moving the needle on their incredible social missions. Outside work, you'll find me learning, volunteering and tinkering with new applications.
