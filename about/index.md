My ["work"][1] stuff is on LinkedIn. Sorta. I've always found it hard to talk about my work history on LinkedIn. It could use some help sprucing it up for sure. Know anyone?

Other than that...

- Dad to a 3 year old and counting

- Quran follower (I try)

- "Tech consultant"
    - Managing multi-faceted projects are fun, some of them anyway
    - Worked mostly with philanthropies, nonprofits and "social enterprises"

- Company founder attempter
    - I'm currently exploring the lively business of death and dying
    - Seriously ðŸ˜±
    - Curious? [Let's talk ðŸ“ž][2]

No such thing as **"[normal eccentric][3]"** is there? ðŸ¤”
